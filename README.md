# Monotweet

A minimal, Twitter-inspired micro-blog built with Jekyll.

## Local setup

Install Ruby, then run the setup script to fetch the project's gems:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

When the installation finishes you can launch a local server with:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site will be available at <http://localhost:4000>.
